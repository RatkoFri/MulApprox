# MulApprox
MulApprox - A comprehensive library of state-of-the-art approximate multipliers

## Overview

The area of approximate multiplier lacks the comprehensive library of state-of-the-art work. Here, we fill this gap by presenting a collection of approximate multipliers in the form of a library. The library enables researchers in this field to compare their solutions with state-of-the-art designs easily. All the Verilog/CMOS implementations and behaviour models of the state-of-the-art and our multipliers is made available publicly, together with the software used for the error assessment and application study. To the best of our knowledge, there is no such comprehensive library of state-of-the-art approximate multipliers publicly available.
